  <description>Adds hours of additional ambient music to the game, all original works improvised on the spot.  (It's a jam!)  Style is a mix of Tangerine Dream, Ambient Music, IDM, and a little bit of classical here and there.  Most tracks are 15-20 mins+ for longer immersion. Current version has about 40 minutes of music, with the final will be between 2-3 hours.  Visit our YouTube playlist for free streaming: http://youtube.com/user/tangerinefm</description>
